Raga Bhairavi is one of the most versatile and emotive ragas in Indian classical music. Though it's traditionally a morning raga, it's often performed at the end of concerts and is widely used in thumri, bhajan, and film songs. Its scope allows the use of all 12 swaras (notes), making it incredibly expressive, especially in conveying pathos, devotion, and nostalgia.
Raga Bhimapalasī (also called Bhim Palasi in Hindustani and Abheri in Carnatic music) is a beautiful raga that evokes devotion and longing. It's typically performed in the afternoon and belongs to the Kafi thaat. Many Hindi film songs have been inspired by this raga. Here’s a list of notable Hindi film songs based on Raga Bhimpalasi:

Arohana (Ascent): Ni Sa Ga Ma Pa Ni Sa
Avarohana (Descent): Sa Ni Dha Pa Ma Ga Re Sa
Vadi: Ma
Samvadi: Sa

This raga is emotive and devotional, often used to convey pathos, love in separation, or devotion.
